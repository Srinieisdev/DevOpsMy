-> GIT is the repository
-> GITHUB is online storage of GIT repositories
-> Create users in github
-> create organisation
-> craete individual account for each one and invite into organisation.
-> give the permistions to them
=> Working directory - Local work space (non Bare repository), 
=> Staging area (Index (OR) buffer area), 
=> Repository area - github (Bare repository) 


1) craete account in https://github.com/  
2) Crate Repository in https://github.com/
3) Click “Clone or Download” button “copy to clipboard” the URL
3) Crate new folder in in any drive. Ex: F:/DevOpsClass1/GITHubProj
4) Open GitBash in “F:/ DevOpsClass1/GITHubProj” path 
5) Administrator@SRINIEIS MINGW64 /f/DevOpsClass1/GITHubProj

#Crate new file (Srini.txt) add some text into that file, now check the status
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        Srini1.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

$ git add Srini1.txt
-------
    git add -A  -> stages All
    git add .   -> stages new and modified, without deleted
    git add -u  -> stages modified and deleted, without new

-------

$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   Srini1.txt

$ git commit -m "Srini text file added"
# Create multiple file in working area, use command for add multiple files (-a commit all uncommited files)
$ git add -A
$ git commit -a -m "Adding srini2 srini 3 and srini1 modified"
# Above commands for all the work saved in local repository, now we have to push local repository code into GitHub repository using bellow command.
$ git push origin master

# It shows the 1st line on every commit
$ git log --oneline 
# It shows the 1st line on every commit
$ git log --oneline 1 (here you can give any number(if you have 100 commits, you want to show onely first 5, than you have give 5)) 


# Create a new branch
$ git branch <branch_name>

# Checkout and create a new branch with that name
$ git checkout -b <new_branch>

# List all remote or local branches

# Checkout an existing branch
$ git checkout <branch_name>
$ git checkout srinibranch1
Switched to branch 'srinibranch1'

# push branch to github account (now this branch name will be display in github account, 
  but this branch files are not merged into master)
$ git push origin "branchname"

# -u means Consider all the branches and everything push to repository
$ git push -u --all

# Push all local branches to remote repository
$ git push --all


# merge new branch in master OR Merge changes into current branch - here merge all the files
$ git merge <branch_name>
$ git merge <source_branch> <destination_branch>

# If you want merge only particular commit (cherry-picking simply means picking a commit from a branch and applying that commit onto another branch.)
$ git cherry-pick sha1sum

# Merge conflict: Test.txt in maser branch and fut1 branch. One developer working in master branch 2nd developer working on fut1 branch. Both are added some lines in test.txt and 
  try to commit than it will give the conflicts. That time we manually go to the file & modify the lines. Then add that file in staging are & commit that. 
- Modify conflict file
  $git add <file>

$ cat /c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
- Copy ssh key from console, go to your account in github.com, settings-> SSH and GPG keys -> new sshkey -> give title “ssh1” and paste coped ssh key from console 
  and “add SSH key” button, activate ssh key from console using below command, after activate ssh key key icon changed it as green colour

# revert back to previous versions in all files, create new file add some text to “rever.txt” (it must be in staging area,)  

$git reset <file>  => revert uncommitted changes
$git reset --soft  => Move only HEAD pointer
$git reset --mixed => Move the HEAD pointer & reset the staging area 
$git reset --hard  => Move the HEAD pointer, reset the staging area and working tree to the new head 




#If you want revert back to the file for previous things. This file committed to repository. we can revert back (last modifications only) 
 any files from repository.
$git revert <shalsham number>


# If we want get back to the particular file. (Ex: file1 – add 1 line & commit, - add 2nd line & commit, -add 3rd line & commit, 
  -delete 3rd line & commit, -again add 3rd line & commit, Now I want file when I add 2nd line, latest HEAD point is 2nd file commit id)
  just we are going to one location to another location.
$ git checkout <commitid> (git checkout currentbranch@@commitid (it will look for your given id in ))
- Now head poison is showing 2nd file commitid, if you want to latest head point now check out brach
$ git checkout <branchName> (git checkout branchName@@latest commit) (use for go to another branch)

# Adding a remote repository with the name of beanstalk
$ git remote add origin git@account_name.git.beanstalkapp.com:/acccount_name/repository_name.git

# List named remote repositories
$ git remote -v
origin git@account_name.git.beanstalkapp.com:/acccount_name/repository_name.git (fetch)
origin git@account_name.git.beanstalkapp.com:/acccount_name/repository_name.git (push)

# remove file 
$ git rm Readme.txt

- If I add one line in file1 and file2 (files must added to local repository)after immediately used $stash than it will back up the current file and undo the current changes.
- here i used stash 3 times
$ git stash

- get the backup list
$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 1845dae Initial commit
stash@{1}: WIP on master: 1845dae Initial commit
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 1845dae Initial commit
- pick one backup from that (latest backup is stash@{0}) - Still all the backup there only if you pick any one also - it never delete backup  
$ git stash apply stash@{1} 
- clear all the backup
$ git stash clear

# Store current work with untracked files
$ git stash -u

# Bring stashed work back to the working directory
$ git stash pop



git rm
Remove files or directories from the working index (staging area). With git rm, there are two options to keep in mind: force and cached. Running the command with force deletes the file. 
The cached command removes the file from the working index. When removing an entire directory, a recursive command is necessary.

# To remove a file from the working index (cached):
$ git rm --cached <file name>

# To delete a file (force):
$ git rm -f <file name>

# To remove an entire directory from the working index (cached):
$ git rm -r --cached <directory name>

# To delete an entire directory (force):
$ git rm -r -f <file name>

- Check the untacked files (just -n means just Show the untracked files)
$ git clean -n
- Now remove the untracked files (-f means It will remove force )
$ git clean -f

# git bisect 

You could try to check out each commit, build it, check if the regression is present or not. If there is a large number of commits, 
this can take a long time. This is a linear search. We can do better by doing a binary search. This is what the git bisect command does. 
At each step it tries to reduce the number of revisions that are potentially bad by half.

You'll use the command like this:

$ git stash save
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad
$ git bisect good 0
