pipeline plugin
	
Role-based Authorization Strategy plug in (for manage user roles)

-> Pipeline
- Pipeline is a work flow with group of events or jobs that are chained and integrated with each other in sequence.
- Every job in pipe line has some dependency on one or more other jobs.

-  This "Pipeline as Code" would be written to a Jenkinsfile and checked into a project’s source control repository
- Create job using "Pipeline" project.
- goto "Advanced Project Options -> Pipeline" catagory. than will get 2 options. 1) pipeline script, 2) pipeline script from SCM
- if we seelct 1st option than we can write the script there only, if you select 2nd than need to create "Jenkinsfile" in GIT repository and write below 
  code in that file

Ex 1:

node('java8') {

  stage('Configure') {
    env.PATH = "${tool 'maven-3.3.9'}/bin:${env.PATH}"
  }

  stage('Checkout') {
    git 'https://github.com/bertjan/spring-boot-sample'
  }

  stage('Build') {
    sh 'mvn -B -V -U -e clean package'
  }

  stage('Archive') {
    junit allowEmptyResults: true, testResults: '**/target/**/TEST*.xml'
  }

}



- selct SCM File location (GIT, svn)
- use "Global Tool Configuration" for give path to differnt tools Like JDK, Git, Ant, Maven, Docker etc
- save job
-> Pipeline Defination 
- agent : 
- tools : 
- stage :
- steps :
- post :

---------------------------------
- Every resource having user name, password in organization. Those credentials can be used in Jenkins. 
  That is called SSO (single sign on). For that we can use LDAP in Jenkins

- when we install "Roles Strategy Plugin, we will get the "Roles based Strategy" in cofigure globel security-> 
  authorization.Now than ony you will get "Manage and Assign Roles" 

- Deploy plugin (Deploy to container)used to deploy war/ear to tomcat/JBOSS. when you install this plugin, 
  you will get the option "Deploy war/ear to a container" in "add post build action"

- Delivery pipeline plugin.
- Build pipeline

----------------------------
For AWS

- Open instance & login -> create user for jenkines slave -> $useradd -s /bin/bash jenkins -> $passwd jenkins -> give the sudo access for jenkins user
  go to $visudo -> add line in that -> jenkins ALL =(all) NOPASSWD:ALL -> save & came out -> login with jenkines user -> $su jenkins
   -> copy link locaton from "slave.jar" in jenkins page -> go to -> AWS instance -> $wget <paste the location here> ->
