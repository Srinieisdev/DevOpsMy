# Create general maven project from command prompt, Create 1 folder, open command prompt in that folder (Need internet connection)
E:\DevopsTraining\Class2\Maven\Proj1\meetings>mvn archetype:generate
# It will show one number for sample maven project 
Ex:
Choose a number or apply filter (format: [groupId:]artifactId, case sensitive contains): 1002:
Choose org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart version:
1: 1.0-alpha-1
2: 1.0-alpha-2
3: 1.0-alpha-3
4: 1.0-alpha-4
5: 1.0
6: 1.1
Choose a number: 6:

# choose 6 and it will ask below:

Define value for property 'groupId': com.eis.erp <company name>
Define value for property 'artifactId': meetings <Project Name>
Define value for property 'version' 1.0-SNAPSHOT: : 1.0
Define value for property 'package' com.eis.erp: : src
Confirm properties configuration:
groupId: com.eis.erp
artifactId: meetings
version: 1.0
package: src
 Y: : Y

Default (or Build) Lifecycle
•	validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
•	compile - compile the source code of the project
•	test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
•	package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
•	verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
•	install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
•	deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

Build Life Cycle of clean phase
1.	mvn pre-clean
2.	mvn clean
3.	mvn post-clean
Site Lifecycle (when we run >mvn site it will create document in /maven_home/project_name/target/site , here we can see created html files  )
•	pre-site
•	site    ()
•	post-site
•	site-deploy
•	The command used in maven to generate javadocs for a given project is 'mvn site'. Basically, when this command is invoked, maven calls 'Doxia' document generation and other report generating plugins.
•	Doxia is basically a framework used for content generation by maven. This generates contents both in static and dynamic ways.

-----------------
- It will adjust all pom versions, parent versions and dependency versions in a multi-module project.
> mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.50.1-SNAPSHOT
- If you made a mistake, do
> mvn versions:revert
- afterwards, or
> mvn versions:commit
- after that install

How to call directly module
> mvn clean -pl <module_name> 
------------------
Build Profile OR Maven Profile (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_build_profiles.htm)

A Build profile is a set of configuration values, which can be used to set or override default values of Maven build. Using a build profile, 
you can customize build for different environments such as Production v/s Development environments.
Profiles are specified in pom.xml file using its activeProfiles/profiles elements and are triggered in variety of ways. 
Profiles modify the POM at build time, and are used to give parameters different target environments 
(for example, the path of the database server in the development, testing, and production environments).

Build profiles are majorly of three types.

Type 		- 	Where it is defined
Per Project 	-	Defined in the project POM file, pom.xml
Per User    	-	Defined in Maven settings xml file (%USER_HOME%/.m2/settings.xml)
Global		-	Defined in Maven global settings xml file (%M2_HOME%/conf/settings.xml)

A Maven Build Profile can be activated in various ways.

    Explicitly using command console input.
    Through maven settings.
    Based on environment variables (User/System variables).
    OS Settings (for example, Windows family).
    Present/missing files.
------------------------
Maven CLI Options
-D,--define <arg>		= Define a system property
-P,--activate-profiles <arg>	= Comma-delimited list of profiles to activate
-o,--offline			= Work offline
-f,--file <arg>			= Force the use of an alternate POM file (or directory with pom.xml).
-s,--settings <arg>		= Alternate path for the user settings file
-fn,--fail-never		= NEVER fail the build, regardless of project result
-q,--quiet			= Quiet output - only show errors
-X,--debug			= Produce execution debug output
